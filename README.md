# weather_app

Application to provide weather forecast for given location.

## Overview

We have built a weather application. This application will show the temperature of a location by user entering the zip code or mentioning the city for which they would like to know the weather forecast for the upcoming 5 days.
To fetch weather information, we have used an API - OpenWeather. OpenWeather API provides a fast and elegant way to fetch weather data. In this Web App, we have asked user to manually enter the location. Then we will send this data to the API.

The fetched data will show the following features regarding the weather:
1.	Approximate temperature
2.	Comparing with the approximate temperature with the actual weather felt by people in that location.
3.	Humidity of that location
4.	Visibility of sky with respect to temperature
5.	Wind flow speed

## Getting Started
